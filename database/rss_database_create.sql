O, and the money is always a good thing too as it does cover most if not all of your tuition. Priority enrollment of 13 units from this scholarship is a great asset to getting the classes you need as many of them do fill up fast.<br>', '<br>Visiting all the colleges I applied to, I found that UCLA was one of the few that had one of the most friendly and laidback campuses. There’s an optimistic atmosphere here at UCLA, yet once you’ve walked down and seen the 20,000 other students going to classes and what not, there is still a sense of competition and, to me, it motivates me to really find my own unique place amongst everyone. Essentially, that is what I wanted my college experience to be like; an opportunity to grow as an individual and to discover what the future may hold for me.<br>\r\n<br>However, let’s not forget the weather here is great. It rarely rains and the sun is almost always out. Honestly, it’s hard to love gloomy skies, below zero days, and other miserable weather conditions at other colleges.

An important part of college is the lifestyle itself. The questions that you should ask yourself and know the answer to should be: Do I like living on the campus? Can I imagine this lifestyle for the next four years or so? Academics should always be an important consideration, but academic success can only be as far reaching as your own personal happiness. As you are all Regents Scholars, the best of the best as the adage goes, there is no doubt you will all succeed academically no matter where you go; the key, however, is to find a place where you can enjoy that path as well. <br>', '', 'psionic3000', 'Chan', 1, '', '2010'),

That being said, prestige is not a bad thing, so don\'t turn down an offer of admission to a prestigious school if it also happens to be your best-matched school or if prestige is the only difference in two schools that you\'re trying to decide between.

Unlike so many other top schools, though, the social life here is equally wonderful. Your experience at UCLA will be as much social as it is academic: you will grow interpersonally as well as intellectually. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis school is amazingly huge and diverse. You\'ll quickly learn that there\'s so much more to a student body than "40% Asian and 40% white". You stop noticing such superficial qualities and view people for who they are; you\'ll meet and befriend so many incredible, down-to-earth, brilliant people of all types, shapes, and sizes. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe more time I spend at UCLA, the more strongly I believe this school simply did almost everything right. The campus layout is perfect: neatly divided between dorms, sciences, and humanities; beautiful and spacious, but not sprawling. The location is awesome: Westwood is the ideal college town, and you\'re a single bus ride away from a myriad of beaches, museums, restaurants, marvelous hiking trails -- you get the idea.

Once you get here, trust me, nobody\'s going to ask you what your SAT score was or how many AP exams you passed. Making your decision is all about knowing the person YOU are and where YOU best see yourself spending four years of your life. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd hey, I\'m no longer a chem major. Wouldn\'t it have stunk if I\'d chosen a school only for its chem program? That\'s how you know a school is THE one: no matter how sharply your plans may change, you\'ll still love it. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDON\'T go where your friends say you\'d fit in best. DON\'T go where your parents keep nagging you or where your family legacy lies. DON\'T go where your favorite teacher would be most proud of you. THIS IS YOUR DECISION. VISIT ALL YOUR SCHOOLS. I strongly recommend visiting ALONE. You don\'t want parents or friends around to sway you or change your experience; you want to see what it\'s like to actually attend the school. Spend a night in the dorms. TALK to people. Eat the food. Ask questions. Walk around. Sit in the back of a class and notice the body language. Sit on a bench or grassy knoll and people watch. Then close your eyes and ask yourself, "Can I see myself here?" Do I belong here? REALLY? \r\n<br><br>\r\nIf the answer is "maybe" or even "I think so," it\'s time to visit your other schools. When the answer is "I wish I could spend the rest of my life here," from deep down in your heart, you\'ve fallen in love with your school -- and that\'s where you belong.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nWhether or not that school for you is UCLA, I wish you nothing but the best.

Give your future self opportunities by choosing a college with many different majors, minors and specialties, as well as research opportunities. Also, ask yourself if you want an intense, competitive academic experience (not necessarily a bad thing, you probably only get one shot at college and getting a unique profession) or a more laid-back one.

Their menu includes ribeye steak, salmon, caramelized pork chops, roasted chicken, eggplant ravioli, creme brulee for dessert. Prices are in the high twenties, but no charge for rent for 60 people.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\nTaix French (Lan)<br>\r\n-http://www.taixfrench.com/banquets.html<br>\r\n-I\'ve heard plenty of good things about this place (online and by word-of-mouth), which serves some fantastic French cuisine. The menu is absolutely xquisite and comes in a wide range of choices starting at 19.95 per entrée (and including soup, salad, carbs, dessert!). Reserving a room seems fairly easygoing; and service is said to very accommodating. Major con? It\'s in downtown.

(tape up posters,  have props in the corners?)<br>\r\n4) Is there a sound system of any sort so we can make speeches?<br>\r\nOur budget is about $30 per person, including gratuity/tax and any room rental charges.\r\nWe\'d probably be there for 2-3 hours for dinner.<br>\r\n5) Looking at the party menu online, I think that Choice 5 is the best for us.  Would be\r\nwe be able to swap an appetizer for a dessert?<br>\r\n6) Is there a fee to rent the room/space?<br>\r\n7) How much would the deposit be?\r\n<br>\r\nWe\'re hoping to hold it the weekend of May 16-18, or May 23.  Are those dates available,\r\nand when would it be cheapest?"<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf possible, once all the restaurant people get back to me, I\'d like to decide on a restaurant and have our next meeting there to see what the food\'s like.
