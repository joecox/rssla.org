      			<li>Provide community service opportunities for those who wish to take advantage of them</li>
      			<li>Foster interpersonal growth amongst Regents Scholars at UCLA</li>
      			<li>Provide resources and guidance to incoming Regents Scholars</li>
      			<li>Promote interaction between Regents Scholars across all University of California campuses</li>
