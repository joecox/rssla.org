				600 third year transfer students are invited to apply for the Regents 
				Scholarship. Of these students, 100 students receive the offer of 
				scholarship. <br><br>
				The application itself is separate from the UC application, and 
				consists of two short personal essays and a letter of recommendation.

				Scholar Society.
