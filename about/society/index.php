                  <p>While our motto of "Scholarship, Service, and Leadership" encapsulates a large part of what we do as an organization, it may be somewhat misleading. We are not a purely academic or professional group, nor do we solely serve as a conduit for networking or self-congratulatory celebration. To the contrary, while we promote a variety of academically stimulating programs every year (the majority of which are open to the public, as well as RSS members), we also strive to provide a comfortable and fun social environment through which incoming Regents Scholars can quickly feel "at home" at UCLA. As a group of just over 300 students, we call ourselves a "society" for good reason.</p>
                  <p>Each year, RSS plans dozens of social events. These include small and simple outings, such as our quarterly bowling championship, study breaks at Citywalk, bonfires at Dockweiler beach, and trips to exciting plays. These also include large blowout style events, most notably our end-of-year Banquet, annual Mountain Cabin Summer Retreat, and annual Beach House Winter Retreat. And while these events are undoubtedly the core of our "Society," we still provide a fantastic array of opportunities for those interested in the more academic and professional benefits of the organization.</p>
                  <p>In the past few years, RSS members have dined with various eminent guests as part of our quarterly "Luncheon Series," including a former U.S. Secretary of State, a former Massachusetts Governor and Democratic Presidential Nominee, a Pulitzer Prize Winner, and a Nobel Prize winner. We've also been privileged with the company of the UC Regents three times, and our quarterly "Distinguished Lecture Series" and "Seminar Series" provide us with fascinating looks into the newest academic developments of the university. Our "Dinner with the Faculty" program provides a unique opportunity for RSS members to interact with faculty in a much more intimate setting than the university normally provides, with an extremely small student-to-faculty ratio. Our annual conference with other UC Regents Scholar Organizations also offers a unique opportunity to meet with talented individuals from all across the state.</p>
                  <p>So, if you are an incoming or current UCLA Regents Scholar, come join us! Check out the rest of this website, as it will describe all that we do in even greater detail. And if you really want to get to know us and what we do, come to a general meeting! If our activities and programs don't intrigue you, feel free to suggest ones that do! The best part of RSS is that we as students make all the decisions regarding our organization, and our leadership loves suggestions. We hope you enjoy your experience as a Regents Scholar and a Bruin!</p>
